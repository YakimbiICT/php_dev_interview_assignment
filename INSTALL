/***************************
    Installation
***************************/

1a. Actually decide to set this up or view the example at imact.lagnus.info, then name Imact is for IMgur/IMage ACTions (favorite/delete/add/etc...)
1b. Install pecl_http by installing pear and then running 'pecl install pecl_http'
2. Copy everything to your server accesible location
3. Update Imact/Base.php with your relevant paths and database settings.
4. Create a database named X or imact, and import the Imact.sql file
5. Test it out, break it, tell me it broke, then I scru(b/m) it!!

It is hardcoded as I wanted to keep things simple, you can pick up a config file parser from anywhere,
and then again a php file with the settings, like config.php is equivalent without needing a real parser, eg. PON.

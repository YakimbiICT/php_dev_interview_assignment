# PHP interview assignment

## Description

Your task is to build a simple web-based image hosting service.
Users can fetch images metadata from an external service (flickr, google images, facebook etc, you choose),
server side or client side it's up to you, and can also set pictures as favorites.
Image metadata are fetched, not the image itself.
Favorite images can have a description.
Favorite images appear on the user's home page.
Users can also delete favourited images.
Users can also delete favourited image descriptions.

### You have to implement the following user stories:

* AS a user, I WANT TO fetch 20 random images data from the choosen external service.
  and see them on the homepage.
* AS a user, I WANT TO favorite an image. (ajax)
* AS a user, I WANT TO add a description to a favourite image. (ajax)
* AS a user, I WANT TO view favorite images.
* AS a user, I WANT TO delete favorite images.
* AS a user, I WANT TO delete favorite image descriptions.

**No user login required.**

You have high expecations from your web app and figure that it's best to provide an API for
developers/other services/mobile devices.
The API should allow the developer to do all of the above using calls to the API. You
can design and implement the API however you want. Of course, we'd also like to see an API client.


## Rules:

* Clone this repo to your github account.
* PHP 5.3 .
* You are not allowed to use any PHP framework. However, you are free to use any PHP library.
* You are free to use any Javascript library.
* You get huge bonus points for writing unit/functional tests.
* Provide a SQL file for creating the database.
* Provide a configuration file and instructions for how to run the app on our machines. An automaded scripts is a plus.
* You have to push the code on your Github account and make a pull request to YakimbiICT/php_dev_interview_assignment repo.
* Not required, but it would be great if you can host the app on the Internet so that we can play
  with it without having to install/configure it. ;-) 

**IF YOU CAN'T USE A PUBLIC REPO ON GITHUB, USE BITCUCKET [[ https://bitbucket.org/ ]] AND SET UP A PRIVATE REPO**
